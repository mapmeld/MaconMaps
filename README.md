# MaconMaps

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mapmeld/MaconMaps.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The repo for MaconMaps includes our <a href="http://maconmaps.com">event page</a>, <a href="http://maconmaps.heroku.com">NeighborDiff</a>, and some experimental maps for the Macon area.

NeighborDiff is a simple tool to update and detail geodata. We're looking for changes a university made in their neighborhood in the 5 years since the local government collected a buildings file.

## Examples

The building highlighted below was replaced by a parking lot. Drag and drop a red marker onto it to set it to Demolished.

<hr/>

This former drive-thru bank has been re-opened as a pharmacy. Let's drag and drop a green marker to set it to Renovated.

<hr/>

The building under construction in the photo below is now a dormitory, and a journalism school is being built across the street. Drag and drop a yellow marker where new buildings should be added to the data.

In the future, NeighborDiff will let you add more information by clicking on interesting buildings.

The output data can be added to OpenStreetMap with this site as proof of community review.

## About CartoDB

The buildings in NeighborDiff are stored on CartoDB. We use their Maps API to display and interact with the buildings, and their Node.js module + SQL API to change the status of buildings as you edit them.

<a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> is a free/freemium mapping database from Vizzuality. You can upload shapefiles and Google Earth KML data to start creating a table.

## About MongoDB

Individual points (the new buildings) cannot be mixed with the buildings data on CartoDB. Instead of using an INSERT command, the points are stored separately in a free MongoDB database from MongoLabs.

## Other technologies used

Leaflet.js from Cloudmade, Wax from MapBox, Geocoder.us for address search

## About Poang

Poang ([github](https://github.com/BeyondFog/Poang)) is a Node.js/MongoDB app built using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework. Poang uses [Everyauth](http://everyauth.com/) for local authentication, [Mongoose-Auth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth) to connect Everyauth to MongoDB (and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as the ODM) for account persistence, and [Connect-Mongo](https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo) as a session store. Most of the code in app.js was generated by Express and all of the code in auth.js after the Comment schema is straight from the Mongoose-Auth docs.

For testing, Poang uses the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework, [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for assertions, [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocks & stubs, and [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/) for lightweight integration testing.

For more details, please see BeyondFog's [blog post](http://blog.beyondfog.com/?p=222) that walks through the various tests in Poang.

### Installation
 
1) Do a git clone:

    git clone git://github.com/mapmeld/MaconMaps.git
    
2) cd into the project directory and then install the necessary node modules:

    npm install -d

3) start up MongoDB if it's not already running:
  
    mongod --noprealloc --nojournal
    
4) start the node process:

    node app.js

### Deploy to Heroku

After you have created a new app on Heroku and pushed the code via git, you will need to use the Heroku Toolbelt from your command line to add the free MongoLab starter addon:

    heroku addons:add mongolab:starter
